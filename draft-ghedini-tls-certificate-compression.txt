         Transport Layer Security (TLS) Certificate Compression
            draft-ghedini-tls-certificate-compression-latest

Abstract

   In Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes, certificate chains
   often take up the majority of the bytes transmitted.

   This document describes how certificate chains can be compressed to
   reduce the amount of data transmitted and avoid some round trips.

1.  Introduction

   In order to reduce latency and improve performance it can be useful
   to reduce the amount of data exchanged during a Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) handshake.

   [RFC7924] describes a mechanism that allows a client and a server to
   avoid transmitting certificates already shared in an earlier
   handshake, but it doesn't help when the client connects to a server
   for the first time and doesn't already have knowledge of the server's
   certificate chain.

   This document describes a mechanism that would allow server
   certificates to be compressed during full handshakes.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used
   in this document.  It's not shouting; when they are capitalized, they
   have the special meaning defined in [RFC2119].

3.  Negotiating Certificate Compression

   This document defines a new extension type
   (compress_server_certificates(TBD)), which is used by the client and
   the server to negotiate the use of compression for the server
   certificate chain, as well as the choice of the compression
   algorithm.

   By sending the compress_server_certificates message, the client
   indicates to the server the certificate compression algorithms it

   supports.  The "extension_data" field of this extension in the
   ClientHello SHALL contain a CertificateCompressionAlgorithms value:

       enum {
           zlib(0),
           brotli(1),
           (255)
       } CertificateCompressionAlgorithm;

       struct {
           CertificateCompressionAlgorithm algorithms<1..2^8>;
       } CertificateCompressionAlgorithms;

   If the server supports any of the algorithms offered in the
   ClientHello, it MAY respond with an extension indicating which
   compression algorithm it chose.  In that case, the extension_data
   SHALL be a CertificateCompressionAlgorithm value corresponding to the
   chosen algorithm.  If the server has chosen to not use any
   compression, it MUST NOT send the compress_server_certificates
   extension.

4.  Server Certificate Message

   If the server picks a compression algorithm and sends it in the
   ServerHello, the format of the Certificate message is altered as
   follows:

       struct {
            uint24 uncompressed_length;
            opaque compressed_certificate_message<1..2^24-1>;
       } Certificate;

   uncompressed_length  The length of the Certificate message once it is
      uncompressed.  If after decompression the specified length does
      not match the actual length, the client MUST abort the connection
      with the "bad_certificate" alert.

   compressed_certificate_message  The compressed body of the
      Certificate message, in the same format as the server would
      normally express it.  The compression algorithm defines how the
      bytes in the compressed_certificate_message are converted into the
      Certificate message.

   If the specified compression algorithm is zlib, then the Certificate
   message MUST be compressed with the ZLIB compression algorithm, as
   defined in [RFC1950].  If the specified compression algorithm is
   brotli, the Certificate message MUST be compressed with the Brotli
   compression algorithm as defined in [RFC7932].

   If the client cannot decompress the received Certificate message from
   the server, it MUST tear down the connection with the
   "bad_certificate" alert.

   The extension only affects the Certificate message from the server.
   It does not change the format of the Certificate message sent by the
   client.

   If the format of the message is altered using the
   server_certificate_type extension [RFC7250], the resulting altered
   message is compressed instead.

   If the server chooses to use the cached_info extension [RFC7924] to
   replace the Certificate message with a hash, it MUST NOT send the
   compress_server_certificates extension.

5.  Security Considerations

   After decompression, the Certificate message MUST be processed as if
   it were encoded without being compressed.  This way, the parsing and
   the verification have the same security properties as they would have
   in TLS normally.

   Since certificate chains are typically presented on a per-server name
   basis, the attacker does not have control over any individual
   fragments in the Certificate message, meaning that they cannot leak
   information about the certificate by modifying the plaintext.

   The implementations SHOULD bound the memory usage when decompressing
   the Certificate message.

   The implementations MUST limit the size of the resulting decompressed
   chain to the specified uncompressed length, and they MUST abort the
   connection if the size exceeds that limit.  Implementations MAY
   impose a lower limit on the chain size in addition to the 16777216
   byte limit imposed by TLS framing, in which case they MUST apply the
   same limit to the uncompressed chain before starting to decompress
   it.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Update of the TLS ExtensionType Registry

   Create an entry, compress_server_certificates(TBD), in the existing
   registry for ExtensionType (defined in [RFC5246]).

6.2.  Registry for Compression Algorithms

   This document establishes a registry of compression algorithms
   supported for compressing the Certificate message, titled
   "Certificate Compression Algorithm IDs", under the existing
   "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions" heading.

   The entries in the registry are:

              +------------------+--------------------------+
              | Algorithm Number | Description              |
              +------------------+--------------------------+
              | 0                | zlib                     |
              |                  |                          |
              | 1                | brotli                   |
              |                  |                          |
              | 224 to 255       | Reserved for Private Use |
              +------------------+--------------------------+

   The values in this registry shall be allocated under "IETF Review"
   policy for values strictly smaller than 64, and under "Specification
   Required" policy otherwise (see [RFC5226] for the definition of
   relevant policies).
