--- abstract

In TLS handshakes, certificate chains often take up
the majority of the bytes transmitted.

This document describes how certificate chains can be compressed to reduce the
amount of data transmitted and avoid some round trips.

# Introduction

In order to reduce latency and improve performance it can be useful to reduce
the amount of data exchanged during a TLS handshake.

[RFC7924] describes a mechanism that allows a client and a server to avoid
transmitting certificates already shared in an earlier handshake, but it
doesn't help when the client connects to a server for the first time and
doesn't already have knowledge of the server's certificate chain.

This document describes a mechanism that would allow certificates to be
compressed during full handshakes.

# Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Negotiating Certificate Compression

This extension is only supported with TLS 1.3 and newer; if TLS 1.2 or earlier
is negotiated, the peers MUST ignore this extension.

This document defines a new extension type (compress_certificate(27)), which
can be used to signal the supported compression formats for the Certificate
message to the peer.  Whenever it is sent by the client as a ClientHello message
extension ([RFC8446], Section 4.1.2), it indicates the support for
compressed server certificates.  Whenever it is sent by the server as a
CertificateRequest extension ([RFC8446], Section 4.3.2), it indicates
the support for compressed client certificates.

By sending a compress_certificate extension, the sender indicates to the peer
the certificate compression algorithms it is willing to use for decompression.
The "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL contain a
CertificateCompressionAlgorithms value:

~~~
    enum {
        zlib(1),
        brotli(2),
        (65535)
    } CertificateCompressionAlgorithm;

    struct {
        CertificateCompressionAlgorithm algorithms<2..2^8-2>;
    } CertificateCompressionAlgorithms;
~~~

There is no ServerHello extension that the server is required to echo back.

# Compressed Certificate Message

If the peer has indicated that it supports compression, server and client MAY
compress their corresponding Certificate messages and send them in the form of
the CompressedCertificate message (replacing the Certificate message).

The CompressedCertificate message is formed as follows:

~~~
    struct {
         CertificateCompressionAlgorithm algorithm;
         uint24 uncompressed_length;
         opaque compressed_certificate_message<1..2^24-1>;
    } CompressedCertificate;
~~~

algorithm
: The algorithm used to compress the certificate.  The algorithm MUST be one of
  the algorithms listed in the peer's compress_certificate extension.

uncompressed_length
: The length of the Certificate message once it is uncompressed.  If after
  decompression the specified length does not match the actual length, the
  party receiving the invalid message MUST abort the connection with the
  "bad_certificate" alert.

compressed_certificate_message
: The compressed body of the Certificate message, in the same format as it
  would normally be expressed in. The compression algorithm defines how the
  bytes in the compressed_certificate_message field are converted into the
  Certificate message.

If the specified compression algorithm is zlib, then the Certificate message
MUST be compressed with the ZLIB compression algorithm, as defined in [RFC1950].
If the specified compression algorithm is brotli, the Certificate message MUST
be compressed with the Brotli compression algorithm as defined in [RFC7932].

If the received CompressedCertificate message cannot be decompressed, the
connection MUST be torn down with the "bad_certificate" alert.

If the format of the Certificate message is altered using the
server_certificate_type or client_certificate_type extensions [RFC7250], the
resulting altered message is compressed instead.

# Security Considerations

After decompression, the Certificate message MUST be processed as if it were
encoded without being compressed.  This way, the parsing and the verification
have the same security properties as they would have in TLS normally.

Since certificate chains are typically presented on a per-server name or
per-user basis, the attacker does not have control over any individual fragments
in the Certificate message, meaning that they cannot leak information about the
certificate by modifying the plaintext.

The implementations SHOULD bound the memory usage when decompressing the
CompressedCertificate message.

The implementations MUST limit the size of the resulting decompressed chain to
the specified uncompressed length, and they MUST abort the connection if the
size exceeds that limit.  TLS framing imposes 16777216 byte limit on the
certificate message size, and the implementations MAY impose a limit that is
lower than that; in both cases, they MUST apply the same limit as if no
compression were used.

# Middlebox Compatibility

It's been observed that a significant number of middleboxes intercept and try
to validate the Certificate message exchanged during a TLS handshake. This
means that middleboxes that don't understand the CompressedCertificate message
might misbehave and drop connections that adopt certificate compression.
Because of that, the extension is only supported in the versions of TLS where
the certificate message is encrypted in a way that prevents middleboxes from
intercepting it, that is, TLS version 1.3 [RFC8446] and higher.

# IANA Considerations

## Update of the TLS ExtensionType Registry

Create an entry, compress_certificate(27), in the existing registry for
ExtensionType (defined in [RFC8446]), with "TLS 1.3" column values
being set to "CH, CR", and "Recommended" column being set to "Yes".

## Update of the TLS HandshakeType Registry

Create an entry, compressed_certificate(25), in the existing registry for
HandshakeType (defined in [RFC8446]).

## Registry for Compression Algorithms

This document establishes a registry of compression algorithms supported for
compressing the Certificate message, titled "Certificate Compression Algorithm
IDs", under the existing "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions" heading.

The entries in the registry are:

| Algorithm Number | Description                   |
|:-----------------|:------------------------------|
| 0                | Reserved                      |
| 1                | zlib                          |
| 2                | brotli                        |
| 16384 to 65535   | Reserved for Experimental Use |

The values in this registry shall be allocated under "IETF Review" policy for
values strictly smaller than 256, under "Specification Required" policy for
values 256-16383, and under “Experimental Use” otherwise (see [RFC8126] for the
definition of relevant policies).  Experimental Use extensions can be used both
on private networks and over the open Internet.

The procedures for requesting values in the Specification Required space are
specified in [RFC8447].
